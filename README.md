This repository contains the **Coffee Markets and Weather** project that explores coffee price patters from 1970 to 2020 versus coffee production and weather.  
The main project is in *Coffee.pbix*. In the page *Data & Methodology* you can find a description of the data used and the steps followed in the analysis.  
The Jupyter Notebook *Coffee_Climate_Regions.ipynb* shows how the ERA5 meterological data were extracted and converted into dataframes (CSV format) for further exploration in Power BI.
