This project explores Arabica and Robusta coffee price patters from 1970 to 2020 in relation to coffee production and weather.

* The main project is in *Coffee.pbix*. The page *Data & Methodology* describes the data used and the steps followed in the analysis.  
* *Coffee Markets and Weather.pdf* provides a non-interactive presentation of the project.  
* The Jupyter Notebook *Coffee_Climate_Regions.ipynb* shows how the ERA5 meterological data are extracted and converted into dataframes (CSV format) for further exploration in Power BI.
